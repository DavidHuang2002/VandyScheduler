# VandyScheduler
Vandy Scheduler is a Chrome Extension that allows you to easily choose classes that do not have conflicting times, automatically putting them into your cart. It creates all possible schedules based on the classes in your cart, and allows you to choose the schedule that best suits you. It does this by adding all available times of a certain class to the class cart when the "Add to Schedule" button is clicked. You can also choose times that you wish to have no class by clicking the "Preferences" button, and the schedules will be sorted or removed accordingly. Then, it allows you to choose the schedule that works best by clicking the "Make Schedule" button. These classes appear in the class cart.
